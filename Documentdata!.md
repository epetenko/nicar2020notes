# Turning documents into data

In the dark: Had 15,000 scanned documents for jury selection 

When Jail becomes a death sentence

Not using machine learning, SQL etc.: Sometimes what you need is organization and strategy

What is structured data?
- Organized 
- Structured - has a data model
- Easy to analyze

Unstructured data can be organized, but not in a way that's useful to us

When to make your own database
- You have a question that documents will answer
- Skip when someone else gathered, or you aren't sure what you need

Know what you have
- What stories do you want to tell from the data? FORM A HYPOTHESIS
- What data points do you need to test that assumption?
- What is the quality of the data?

Start w question, then find data sources
- Had semi-structured and unstructured data

You need a plan: Budget and scope
- Are all the data you need in the docs? Read through 5-10 different documents
- How are you going to extract them?
- Review your methodology with people before you start entry

You need a plan: Entry and fact-checking
- Why is doing entry: What skills they have -- do people need training?
- Who is doing fact-checking and how? -- double entry, spot checks?
- Factor in time of data entry and editing of data
- Is it very easy to underestimate how long data entry will take

Write it all down!

Always ask for the database first

## Custody deaths
- Demo data, custody status, responsibility and manner of death
- Autopsy report -- opinion of manner of death

Questions I have 
- Why isn't this person in jail or custody??
- Where do these forms come from?
- Add follow up questions as part of your methodology
- How and where do you get the location of death vs whree they were held?
- Issue: Medical terminology

Reporting questions
- Was the person on opioids or antipsychotic?
- Have they been in jail for long amount of time?
- How long between death and response?
