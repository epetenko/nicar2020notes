# Localizing affordable housing stories and data

### 1st person -- 

Frame stories for your community
- Where are people living in your community and why?
- How are people able to afford where they're living?
- Why is it hard to find a place to live in your community?
- What solutions have been proposed to solve the affordable housing crisis where you are?

**Data to ask for today**
- Public housing authority eviction filings: "We did everything we could" but now they have to move
- Section 8 waiting list numbers: How many people are waiting, when was the last time it was opened
- Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing vouchers: What landlords take this, how many have these but can't use them?
- Public housing authority capital needs budget: How much money do you have to fix your housing and complexes, what are they spending their capital money on?
