Emergency preparedness

What should our govts had in place beforehand to prepare for this?
- This is something we do every day: We have infectious disease outbreask every day throughout the country
- It's similar to other outbreaks, like measles -- we work together on a daily basis
- We are monitoring disease rates every day w an epidemiologist, public health lab, and us 
- Everyone is gonna have a flu pandemic or infectious disease plan ready to go
- In December: Always watching the news for US and around the world
- Have briefings written for all sorts of diseases that never had to be sent everywhere
- We started active planning as soon as we returned from Christmas: Had to pull out old docs and update it
- No one is creating response plans from scratch. Things like social distancing 

Medical issue vs public health issue
- Some diseases like Ebola: gonna take a lot of patient care - someone with Ebola is extremely sick, so a lot of info has to go to doctors
- Because people are not as sick, this is a public health trying to contain and mitigate against spread of disease
- Health depts speak with CDC on daily basis. Docs are not gonna be speaking as much
- Physicians want to go on news, they try to talk about a disease. They're not going to speak to the number of cases, etc. 
- Hard to get your health director in front of camera: Stand up for the city hall and be the face of this

Public health departments underfunded. What can reporters do to get on the phone?
- Easier to get a written statement or phone call than in person interview
- Easier to get early morning interview b/c later in day they have briefings later in the day
- Easier to get them at press conferences, they may be only opportunity
- News agency will not come and ask all the questions we covered already

Propublica: How did you come to this story?
- EIC said, hey I think we should get into coronavirus -- published four days later -- came together really fast
- From HK, lived through SARS and covered some outbreaks before
- To some degree, I just lucked out
- Started with a question: I noticed a lot of other country doing high volume testing, I had noted taking NYC a couple days to get answers to their tests (all negative at that point): Why taking a couple days response?
- Figured it was going to CDC: Why didn't they have local capability yet?
- Started calling epidemiologists and asked how are we doing overall: One said, let's go OTR 
- Gradually came to fact that CDC had decided to make its own test

Kaiser 
- Heard flu surveillance network hadn't been activated: Found out that protocol for who would be tested is very narrow
- Everyone is underneath the CDC
- Other countries have things that are not happening here

Propub 
- surveillance testing: Look at people who have the symptoms but test negative for the flu, start proactively looking to see where the spread is
- Go to start a pilot program of where the spread is in 5 cities, doesn't actually happen
- Sources of information: **Put out a callout**, ask people for help -- 1st call was to association of public health labs and other familiar sources of hers (if local phds are busy, contacting state or national org might be better)
- Evantually pubbing new longer-turn story on infectious control in hospitals with previous violations. Ended up doing it as one big team. 
	- Lead reporter came out with a reporting plan, then gives the marching orders
	- Did not have the violations reports in advance: Pulled inpsection reports from hospitalinspections.org - Assoc of Health care journalists
	- LR had list of designated ebola treatment hospitals, figured that's where acute cases are going to

Coronavirus stress test: Many 5-star Nursing Homes have inspection control lapses
- Anytime a natural disaster hits, the 1st place you look are the places that are in the way

Sarah (NOLA)
- No cases in NOLA yet
- When fed govt issued travel restrictions, my team took a little bit of a breath
- Between that thing and now, we had this thing called Mardi Gras: We had to stop worrying about COVID and start focusing on that (had some issues this year)
- The following day - CDC issued briefing on social distancing, creating panic across the country
- Had to do so much outreach because city councils are tweeting info that we are trying to get corrected
- Every church in NOLA wants to talk to us individually. We don't have time for those things
- We put together a conference call and they complain that they can only bring 1 person


Propub
- Lot of numbers being thrown around right now
- X number of kits, samples, etc.: **Talk in terms of patients**
- Each CDC kit translates to 700 test runs, but each test you run 2 samples per patient
- We want to be able to walk into an office and order a test, but there's a gap in capacity and manpower
- in the US there were 9 deaths -- fatality rate in the US is 11 percent: You know that's bogus
- Take these numbers with a grain of salt: What's the definition of a denominator? 
- People wanna know: If I get this, will I die? but they don't have the denominator of total cases. 

NOLA 
- We know a lot more about the flu: If this many people are tested, this is how many people probably have it
- We don't have that ability for COVID yet
- We wanna be really straightforward and clear: Ask them to explain the data you're looking at
- Lot of public officials you want to hear from: I'm texting my boss stats while I brush my teeth, she knows what that means
- Explaining to the mayor or a local poli what the stats mean, they struggle with that. Very long conversation.

Kaiser 
- Most newsrooms have someone with public health or science expertise
- Lot of people in the conferences are political reporters and ask political questions

Q&A

Q: What happens if not getting a response
- You may have to give people a little bit more time than this
- We're meeting with hospitals regularly to get ready for our 1st case. 
- Even at the city level, I know what I want to do with civil staff but I don't run the civil service
- Keep things in back pocket like work from home policy or state of emergency
- Get vague answers because they are still figuring out those details

Propub
- Huge variability from hospital to hospital
- Health care workers saying I'm hearing no plan from management, and it's freaking me out

Sarah
- Look for hospital inspections from CMS
- Unionized nurses and other workers: Reach out to them

Propub
- Nurses at one hospital know nurses from another hospital

Q: Infection control -- how to tell how hospitals are doing

Propub -- look backwards: There is a specific citation by CMS inspectors that is "infection control"
- Looking forwards: Do want to have a specific standard, have a separate third party source making a call for you
- What are good metrics for PPE: Supplies from one hospital to another in your area

Sarah: Have they been trained on things like "donning and doffing"

Q: Plans for COVID: How do we access them?

NOLA: Most plans are not gonna be released to journalists. We submit a modified version publicly
	Have they thought out all scenarios? Outreach, quarantine, social distancing
	Might not have specific trigger points because situations are fluid
	In this situation; So many people have mild illness that they may be at home (self-quarantined) but think of other options like alternative care options, isolation sites
	Nursing homes, homeless populations


Kaiser: States are supposed to put together crisis standards of care
How well has it been filled out?

Q: What is flow of information from CDC to VP?
NOLA: I don't really have a good idea. We talk to the CDC and state health departments
They tell us what guidance they're working on.
Locally, having a lot of conversations about closures. Where politics are coming into play
Lot of school boards want to close even though it's not appropriate. Here, lot of questions about tourism and asking about what triggers are necessary

Q: Trends in reporting that are similar or different to other epidemics?
Propub
- Mortality rate: I hate putting something like that in a headline

NOLA: We know more in some ways than previous epidemics, but there's also a lot we don't know still

Propub -- things are changing really quickly, public health agency could tell you something in the morning and then change their minds that day
Number in headline was accurate Wed night, but 12 hours later my number was dead wrong
Date your information -- as of Wed morning, someone said this

State tests someone and gets positive: It's presumptive positive
Then CDC will test and confirm
In LA a test could come back in hours, but CDC will take days

Propub: My guess is that CDC will soon decline to test every case
