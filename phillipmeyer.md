- Sharing information is key to collaboration
- Find the GIS experts -- they'll talk 
- Government data can be siloed - connect it for a story

Forced Out
- Measuring the scale of the conflict in South Sudan
- Lot of displacement - allegations, but didn't have traditional access
- How to reach those people w/o internet access, literacy
- Al Jazeera mobile phone survey - 6 local languages, 14 questions: Asked if forced off by government soldiers
- Sent out on random dial system and 40,000 people picked up -- 406 in total answered, very expensive and people were afraid to talk
- Combined with satellite imagery (used a more expensive, private system)
- Would sit with people and figure out where their house was
- Research in past had been in small accessible pockets - but modeled research methods off of existing, small research to expand
- 2-year process: Survey was complicated to design
Takeaways 
- Test first before doing your main analysis: Started with 17 questions in survey
- Ensure you are doing everything possible to catch flawed responses
- Be transparent about your method: We know we're not perfect, just tell people what you have
- Corroborate data with other types of evidence - ended up matching with UN resources

NPR: Code Red - Baltimore's Climate Divide
- Health and heat in cities (I think Newark was in there?)
- CMS data, hospital records, some data on heat in specific parts of city
- Station wagons sent across the city
- Got sensors from grant to put in living rooms, bedrooms etc to measure temp and humidity
How could we potentially make this a national story? How to get precise temp readings across the country
- Try to get weather stations - some cities have many, but some only had 1-2
- Always thought there was no real difference in a single city -- but not true 
- Does this relate to income? (Yes)
- Landsat satellite - able to make maps for 96 cities across the US
Lessons learned:
- Think big -- see if there's more out there to work with
- Confirm methodology with experts -- you do not need to have them come out later and say your numbers are wrong
- Show even non-experts your data: People who live on the ground


Q+A
- GIS people usually don't have anyone calling them up
- Someone recently laid off government agency who knows this stuff
- Try to meet them in person: Arranged a coffee meeting at a conference - able to tap someone for hours of work because there was a personal connection
- Contact them before you need them - not gonna work with you if you just pop up at the last second
- Especially valuable when editors don't want to hear about what you're doing
- Some experts all they care about is being quoted -- starting early helps with that
- This is gonna be the best thing ever -- this is never gonna work - an expert said early on this is a stupid idea
- There are going to be moments like that, feels like everything's gonna fall apart -- but it's a chance to realign
- We failed - we decided to take a deeper look at the system itself, one judge makes all those decisions: Huge break for us
- Sometimes overall findings are underwhelming, but sometimes the story is a specific subset (liability lawsuits specifically are very secretive)
- Focus your lens through the most vulnerable communities
- Put tests in your data; Even really small-scale, test the data yourself
- Layer evidence - not just one dataset to work with -- to get geolocation, asked where the nearest school was
- Always a way to slice the data in a smaller lens -- rather than 5,000 communities, just look at where maximum fire hazard is - use that quick story to pitch a longer term project
- mine your local courthouses for sealed records
