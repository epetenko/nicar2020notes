# How to negotiate for data and records

1. How to figure out what's out there
- Assume whatever you want exists, figure out the magic keywords
- "It's paper only": "Well, how do you see it?"
- Ask them to descibe what they have and how they keep it
- Check out the statue that governs their agency to figure out if they have to have it
- Be curious/nosy
- **Get the blank forms of whatever agency you cover: There's no reason they can't give that to you -- find out what they're calling things**
- Give me the contracts and purchases you have for all your databases, or the schema for that database (had to go to trial to see if that was private)
- Check the open data portal -- it may be a crappy version, but it shows it exists
- Take the records person out for coffee
- FOIA the FOIA logs -- if you have a beat, good especially if you are just starting; can see if someone else got it for free
- Search Document Cloud, Muckrock, IRE/NICAR tipsheets, other states have advice for your state
- FOIA vs local sunshine laws: Use EPA to circumvent your local public records law

2. First impressions can really matter
- Be kind, be direct, help me help you
- Good cop/bad cop: Start off super nice, then when denied - show me where in the law it says I can't have it
- I'm not gonna stop asking you, so just give it to me now
- Never apologize for these requests: You are entitled to your request

3. Why do they always start out by saying no? 
- Interview the no. Get a better understanding
- Let's get weird: Wrote one a poem! Get a better understanding of human behavior, hostage negotiation, 129 cars (sales tactics)
- I would always rather have leverage than luck. Understand what it is that's motivating them: Threaten to get it from another agency/competitor, write a story about it, don't let them walk away with a no & keep asking questions

4. $660,000,000 request: What do you do now?
- Told them to just walk around the office and count them instead
- Always ask them for a detailed cost estimate
- This seems like so much work; Is there any way to make it easier?
- Call them every day and ask how they can reduce the cost
- Ask to inspect the records - bring a batch scanner!
- Time/cost vs output of effort - expensive vs time consuming vs data is messy 

5. Other obstacles
- FBI is the worst! - Central Records System is the worst because everyone tells you to go there, even if it's a contract
- They use their information advantage against you at every opportunity
- Mistake: Writing requests that are basically questions (Ask for records sufficient to show the number of cars you have) - don't care what the records are, invoices, etc. -- or you could just tell me
- Afraid of missing stuff and make requests really broad
- **Don't be afraid of iterations**
- Don't get a fake rejection; Force them to give you an official rejection -- don't let them drag you out by making you leave messages

### Bodycam footage from Chicago
- FOB spokesperson will go around to cops, collect info and then tell you what happened
- Got a tip to request ME reports -- didn't quite match
- City settles suit with family w agreement to not release videos
- City still says pending investigation long after shooting happened
- My client was independent journo -- statue says not only says pending investigation, but has to be that it would interfere with pending investigation of requested agency -- IL had never changed that to make it harder
- We made request to CPD, which was not investigating - the AG was investigating -- and it couldn't have interfered with their investigations because they weren't doing one


## Developments in federal FOIA

Reality:
- Backlogs are getting bad under Trump
- Not devoting enough funding - using "use it or lose it" philosphy
- More lawsuits now: DC courts are slowing down their processing rate, and judges blame reporters too
- Better luck in other jurisdictions
- Grant expedited processing: Still have problems with the success rate

- Twitter: @mvtopic

## Q&A
- FOIA everything related to the processing of your request: Might find out exactly how long it took them
- "I would also like to be included in any and all emails connected to this request"
