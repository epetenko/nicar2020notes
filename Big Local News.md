# Big Local News

- Released local policing lab and partnered with students, built tutorials to analyze data and trained about 200 journos

- Now see local journalists doing stories on their department's problems

- LAPD pulled back on doing random stops 

Next goal: 
- Civil asset forfeiture 
- Public employeee pensions: People within the pensions, where worked, what's happening with those folks
- Pilot projects that will knit together partners and give journalists support

Provides way to share data with journalists
- Law Enforcement Accountabiity Network -- police disciplinary data
- They are only able to give us -- everything else is up to us

Create projects, add files to that project, then add group to a project -- can add users who can access data you have
API: Allows for plugins -- datasette, FIPS lookup tool, Labeler 

FIPS tool -- autopopulate any csv file that has state or county information, or the other way around

Archiving and sharing your data with the public
Return a persistent URL that is saved forever: People can download it from the archive and recorded in searchworks
- Right now: Not super sophisticated method, have to email Stanford -- but soon should be able to just publish

It's a DocumentCloud for data

Python SDK?
