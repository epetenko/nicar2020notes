# Verdant data for local investigations

From documents to datasets

## Boston reporter

Where to get data: 
- Break down what's available at the federal level: Compliance reports, audits, inspections even of private entities
- Create your own database
- What nonprofit is collecting data?
- McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act -- showed growth in homeless youth and unaccompanied youth w/o parent or guardian
- Death data -- is it publicly available in your state? Looked at youth suicides
- Eviction data -- Right to Counsel in evictions proceedings
- How many people are dying in local jails? BJS statistics, but had to create our own database based on public records requests from county sheriffs
- Illicit massage maps - use rub maps to see where people are buying sex
- Wrongly convicted in Mass -- getting compensation after jail

- Massive fire -- got a weird warrant based on a Google Map, every single device ID within this location -- dragnet
- Went to county courthouse and fought to get every single search warrant -- found other examples
- One particular affordable housing project was weirdly cited twice
- Able to find the actual location of people in the dragnet
- This is probably happening where you live
- Find out what's kept and how. And think about what to ask for
