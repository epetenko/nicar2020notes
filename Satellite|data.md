# Turning satellite images into data

Started w Burkina Faso - jihadists threatening mines with violence

Satellites critical to journalism
- Reveal: Landsat imagery to examine CA wildfires
- Propublica: LA coastline
- Reuters: Rohingya violence

Ready-to-use data abundant
- academics churning out lots of satellite-derived datasets
- Ex. We needed an artisanal mine dataset -- World Bank contract hired Canadian firm to get imagery
- What if someone hadn't done that?

The old days...
- 1st example -- St. Petersburg Times loss of Florida wetlands: Took a long time
- Now, Google Earth Engine: Can calculate the median baseline of NDVI across decades in seconds

Data more important than ever
- Climate change
- Land use/land cover
- human rights

- How do we continue to push this data for public service journalism?
- In many cases: Use satellite-derived data such as USGS -- but best data is one we create ourselves

Image of madagascar; one of the 1st images that NASA had to take back their press release on -- they identified as forest fires, but it was controlled burn for maintaining fields

Want to be sure that you're talking to the right people for what you're studying

Talked to people on 3 continents and studied many other examples of fires

Google Earth: Fort McMurray, Alberta -- costliest wildfire in Canada's history
