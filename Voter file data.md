# Voter file data

- Has name, how many registered and their party affliation
- Might not be able to tell who they voted for, but sometimes whether they voted
- Before you dive in too deep, states also tend to have summary data
- But if you want to know how many unaffliated hispanic women voted...

How do I get a voter file
- Varies by state to state: some easy some hard
- FL is great! -- can see people getting voter mailers based on it

Using voter file data in FL
- Read your data definitions and look for new columns
- Had to use code to merge 2 text files

Story ideas with voter files
- Voter file comparison -- who is being purged from one month to the next
- New registrations by location
- How active various demographics are at voting
- Where people of different demographics are moving from year to year

## Texas voter data
- Why use: 16 million voters in TX -- up from 15.6 in 2016
- One of the fastest growing areas of the US
- Who are these new Texans showing up to vote?
- Not subject to FOIA -- fill out form, sign an affadavit -- really expensive -- usually parties that end up having it

Matt dempsey tried to file, told it would cost $3600 -- got other newsrooms in TX to split cost of data -- over 20 newsrooms joined as partners!

Info in data: Date of birth, location, party, election history
- Only a snapshot: Vs a living, breathing database
- Voting history is only available for currently registered voters

Stories: 
- Find out the average voter in each county in TX
- Students being registered in certain location -- everybody was registered at one address

Voter rolls useful for a lot of things
- Names, phone numbers, narrow down sources by age and gender
- Can use to confirm information for a single person

KY vote -- Conservative talk radio host who said she had been registered as a Dem against her will
- Got actual registration form, she had marked herself as registered

Politicians can misuse the voter file
- Will flag where you register to vote, which could include social service offices
- KY secretary of state story -- missed it

A clean voter roll is good and not every cleaning is a purge
- States benefit by keeping voter rolls cleaned
- Bloated voter rolls will assign resources to places that don't need it
- They do not typically publish who they removed but will sometimes give if you ask
- KY voter roll has the most bloated in the country -- had just put a flag on

Voter rolls are public: Don't be surprised if someone uses it!

## Q&A

Finding old voter file: Check out academic research on voter files, other journos, etc. FOIAing the FOIA list for voter files for the date you're looking for. Can also ask parties but be careful.

Wisconsin -- over $12,000 to get the statewide voter list -- don't have any demo data like age
- I looked up people i knew and they were wrong on corporate sites (L2?)
- Possible WI was making data entry errors -- if you just want to spot check a sample from a vendor, can go to that specific county: Can check if the same 
- different data fields can have different levels of accuracy
- They try to ballpark people's demographic info based on their behavior and life, which can be very off
- Texas data: Hispanic surname field to get an estimate of whether they are hispanic (although another dataset had probability field)

Electionland: Sign up to be a partner, IRE also has some initiatives

Companies will do "scans" of voter websites and claim they are unsecure, but they're not usually thorough or accurate

What about states that don't pub that data at all? What about corporate sources?
- They're going to be joining fields from different places -- do your best to figure out what it actually means
