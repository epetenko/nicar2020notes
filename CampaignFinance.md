Receipt: Your contribution will be reported as a receipt to the FEC
What about giving my phone? -- In-kind contributions 

All contributions are receipts, but not all receipts are contributions, so many will exceed the legal limit

Offset of expenditures: If I overpay a vendor, that's a different kind of receipt, but still needs to be reported
FEC makes them describe those things in the filings -- sometimes it doesn't literally say that.

I had to pay a politician for the cost of the flight, it showed up as a receipt -- not a contribution

Center for Responsive Politics - had to filter out other types of receipt

FEC: Most timely filings
Industry giving: Center for Responsive Politics
Previously undisclosed donors: Never ends up on campaign's filing, but can see if went through ActBlue/ActRed

ActBlue/Red: Can start to see them on FEC.gov, would see as contribution to the PAC and then see it on candidate's report

Can see more small dollar donors than ever before
Download them, store in a database and then query those: Super large filings, need some acumen to understand idiosyncracies of the FEC data

Derek's propublica itemizer -- has state by state data 

Looking for an individual donor: Open Secrets helpful for making sure that you have the right name/right connections
- Each donor will have an individual ID, but with hundreds of millions of records we do tend to prioritize big donors

ActBlue: At risk of counting donors twice b/c candidates will also submit the transaction separately if it's large enough

If you want to see the universe of donors for a candidate, go to their itemized filings first then ActBlue 
- Still will not get all of the money: Some will still have some other way of getting the money in without ActBlue
- Do that matching exercise with a smaller subset of donors/candidates

Candidates will report 2 contribution records: One in name of ActBlue, and memoed -- then the next will have a name of an individual
Can show up four times for a single contribution

State: National Institute of Money in State Politics
Sometimes have to call them 
But generally, people who give political money have strong reason for doing so and do so many times
If they are doing it for the first time, it might be a good idea to dig deep

FEC: Transaction Types
- How to filter those?
- Open Secrets: Developer tools
fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/transaction-type-code-descriptions
Generally falls under 15s, 30s

Used to be filed on paper : can see pdf forms on FEC's website to show how the campaigns report this information
Each form is labeled, there are instructions, but the form types correspond to data

Check the memo line, it can clarify whether it's really a contribution or what

Check out excessive contributions for politicians
- FEC sends letters to Trump? They could be putting into an account and waiting to refund it
- Many people have repeat contributions -- they're responding every time they get a text
Hard even for campaigns to figure out whether they're over the limit -- they're doing the same fuzzy matching we are

"Due to a technological error, the following contributions inadvertinently attributed to the wrong individual" - two people with same first name and same zip code

How certain can I be of this? Kinda certain, but there's no slam dunks

Refunds: Often just regret, but it could also be that they don't want that person's money -- why?

WinRed is not a comprehensive database of small donors, partly because of less concentration in the market -- but can be close for Trump, check the summary numbers 

Non-contribution accounts

Super PAC - spend "dark money" on TV ads, independent expenditures - but can give limited amounts to candidates

Can accept contributions for independent expenditures only -- can mean they're very similar to super PACs
Vote Vets -- a super PAC that also gives money

Have multiple levels of PAC that can do different kinds of politicking

Might have to look elsewhere from FEC to find super PAC money
"Gray money" -- partially disclosing contributions
Can see over time -- dark money will stop and then hands things off to finish the term because they'll have to disclose anyway

To get an idea of donations -- make a distinction between money going directly to a candidate, and money being spent on their behalf
You make a sandwich vs someone buying you a meal

Bitcoin contribution; Some might be misreporting, others might say they have an obligation for reporting what you received and then the value of what you received when converting it
No one reporting it in a standardized way

What stories are people not doing?
- We're putting out the list of top industries, but we don't know who those people are, you do -- so like to see what people do with it
- We look at macro-level Sanders donors, but many are very different than who we've considered political donors
- State parties have been the losers of the last 15 years of campaign finance law, yet they are charged with doing the groundwork during elections
- Check out the events put together through EventBrite

FERA filings: Meetings with foreign lobbyists and the congress members vs date of contributions
