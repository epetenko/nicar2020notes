# Elections beyond the horse race

## First person - missed name
Women candidate tracker:
- See the races with women

So you have to make a live results page
- Design really, really, really matters
- People are anxious about the results of the elections

Countdowns, tickers, etc create a lot of stickiness but increase nervousness

NPR 2012 results page: Replay the election Tetris-style, electoral votes come down

Election results can be narratives, too; Give entire sentences as updates

We stan the accumulating steppy chart

Choose context by looking into the past

## 538 graphics

- Live forecasting on election nights: Learn some lessons from that

2016: The readers are coming!

Flagship election project that we're known for has just become obsolete: The Forecast Model

Didn't have data feed b/c we couldn't afford it 

We ended up doing a very neutral chart

2016 challenges and takeaways
- Forecasts were really a lagging indicator
- Hand-recording live results: very resource intensive
- Only answered what: No context
- Separate page from our liveblog, which is what people wanted to see

### Joined ABC in 2018 - what now?
Lot of pressure to do something big: "The needle! Let's do it!"

We learned some things!
- Only in the right rail of the liveblog: Keep it close to the context
- No results app but latest results tables throughout the night that updated automatically to provide snapshots
- Incorporate priors better, give some sense of how the night was going in a visual way

Learning:
- Every result in 300px
- The model was being too aggresive: Republican odds randomly peaked over 50%
- Reserve resources, stay light and versatile
- Use priors within graphics for contextualizing
- Updating tables are wonderful
- No model (We'll see about the general)

## Q&A
- Advantage of regional outlets: Can bring more demographics and context to that, bring in campaign finance data, etc.
- Can also have small races with interesting strong divides

Polls about other non-horse race stuff (issues, referendums)
- Early votes in Texas; Sanders had pretty big chunk, biden maybe changed their minds
- It's about aggregation for the horse race: Frees up space for polls nerds to talk about other stuff
