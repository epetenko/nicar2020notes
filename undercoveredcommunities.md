# Covering undercovered communities


## Queer community 

Government data
- US treasury 
- CDC data 
- The most detailed map of gay marriage in America - 2016
- Tax returns - most people who are married file tax returns

Public opinion data
- Gallup, Pew research center, Quinnapiac -- longitudinal attitudes over time

Academic research data, nonprofit reseach data (LGBTQ task force, human rights campaign -- but bias that comes with it)


Make your own data
- Original documents, surveys, news reports, headlines
- Combine multiple data sources into one measurement

Gay rights in the US, the guardian: Had to go out and do the groundwork

Data limitations:
- Using proxies for queer people
- Census: Doesn't actually ask any questions on sexuality -- just captures same-sex households
- Sampling and miscoding errors -- small errors in big pop means large error in smaller population
- We have undercounts minorities, non-binary/gender-nonconforming people
- Most vulnerable pops feel at risk if they answer honestly: 30 states have no protections for jobs
- We're not asking the right questions: Survey questions haven't caught up to queer community

Queering the map: Crowdsourced

Who are the experts?
- Consult with experts ahead of your reporting
- What angles have not been covered? -- we'd reported on hospital deaths before, but not the bigger system and the attempt to take control of them
