# A guide to hosting a NICAR session

I've been a conference teacher/guide/facilitator at previous conferences and taught journalists at my own newsroom before. But this year was my first designing, testing and teaching a hands-on class on my own, specifically the Fundamentals of Javascript, and while I tried to do my best to ease the burden, there were a lot of things coming out of the session that I want to improve on my next time. These are my notes to myself.

Prepping materials and testing your outline can be a lot of work on top of your everyday schedule, and I'm sympathetic to anyone who doesn't have the time. But keep in mind, your coding class can be a NICARian's first introduction to programming and can make them feel confident and happy to delve into coding -- or discourage them from trying again. Even if you can't take every single step in the "prep" section, try to come to the room with a student-centric mentality. Imagine what your class looks like through their eyes, and you'll capture a lot more students.

### The material

#### 1. Tell them why they're going to learn this

Realistically, your students are not going to learn to code in an hour. And they usually know that. They're there because they want to get an outline of understanding to help guide their deeper learning into the material. They want to know: What is this tool used for? Why use this rather than anything else?  Your students may be new NICARians or just not know the broader environment of programming, so having that contextual knowledge is as important as any specific method you can give them. Include examples of your own stories that have come out of it if you can. 

I didn't do this, but in the future I would also include a slide very quickly of what I plan to cover in the class, what my expectations were and and what we were not covering in the class. That way people can be mentally prepared for each component and understand what they are supposed to understand. 

#### 2. Leave plenty of time for setup

Sure, the conference laptops have your files on them and all the software needed to follow your work. But those files are buried in a folder of other materials, and getting them to work is its own struggle. If your students are there to learn a brand-new coding language, they may not know how to use Sublime Text -- or what it is. There's a good chance they're never used the command line before, so leave plenty of time to run that server or execute that command. Include this step in your tutorial or slides, too. This is a really good time to take advantage of a coach who can thumbs-up the fact that everything is running before going forward.

#### 3. Organize, and then organize your organization. 

One thing I think I did well was from the beginning: I broke down what I thought were the essential components of using basic Javascript, then broke down those components into their components. Next time I may even take it further and create a concept map, taking a basic example and physically pointing out (for them or just for myself) the different chunks of knowledge that are needed for that first simple project. Your students should be able to quickly skim the outline of the course, then fill in the gaps as you explain what's happening. It makes it easier to follow along.

#### 4. Less is more

You may be thinking that it's tough to add all this pre-planning and extra information when you have **so much material** to cover. This may be controversial, but in my opinion, the solution is to cover less. It's better to give them one solid, simple example to build off of, with potentially an explanation of what else they can do, than to try to cover every possible potential use of the tool. Teach deep, not broad.

#### 5. Admit when something doesn't make sense

You know from experience that some coding rules and tips are idiosyncratic or downright nonsensical. Your students, meanwhile, are sitting there asking themselves, why? Why is this like this? Just tell them if something is BS. 

#### 6. Show them the errors, the comments and the printing

Your students are going to need to troubleshoot once they're on their own. How are they going to do that when they panic the first time they see a big red "Error"? Going over it in class could help calm that fear. And comments, while not the "essential" bits of the actual code, are pretty damn essential to the workflow of the average coder.

#### 7. Act it out

I don't know if there's a better way to explain concepts like loops and if/then statements, but in my attempt to provide an example, I physically picked up things on my desk and followed instructions like they were given to me. In the future I think I might expand that to more concepts and actually do it deliberately rather than improvising it at the last second. Besides giving people who aren't intuitive coders an idea of what something really means, I think moving around a bit just wakes people up!

#### 8. Leave them with things they can try next

Ok, they've successfully followed your tutorial today. That's great! What can they do next week or next month to practice what they learned? As you may have realized from your coding history, your real coding experience starts when you code something from scratch rather than copying-and-pasting. They may also be asking, where do I go to learn how to use this tool? That's a big one: They should leave the room with plenty of suggestions for places they can extend their knowledge.

### Preparing the material

#### 1. Don't reinvent the wheel

What tutorials have you relied on when you learned to code? What tutorials, books, courses etc. do people recommend the most to someone learning programming? You can use those as a basis for your tutorial rather than coming up with something brand-new. Chances are those people had more experience teaching and spent more time thinking about the best way to teach this than you will, so take advantage of that.

#### 2. Follow your own tutorial

Ok, you've written it out and have it up on your Github or in some slides. Now let it sit a little bit. Come back a few weeks later, and go through it again as though you were a student in your own class trying to follow your own instructions. That's when you'll realize that you missed a step, or that you forgot to tell them to open the console, or all the little missteps that you didn't think of the first time.

#### 3. Write out a plan

I had slides, so I didn't really do this, but if you're going off of a live example, try to write out a basic outline of how you're going to go through the material and how long you expect each component to take. It can keep you more focused on the big picture rather than the small details of the different parts of each example/chunk.

#### 4. Test it out with a newbie ... and an expert

This one does kind of rely on a ~sucker~ volunteer, but you may want to bring in someone new to the subject and try to teach them one-on-one in the same time period you have for the class. They'll have their own questions and thoughts that will illuminate what you need to add, and the practice will help a lot for timing your session and practicing your explanations. 

On the other hand, showing your tutorial to a practiced NICAR teacher, if you can get ahold of one, is also a great way to get feedback. They will know more about what the actual sessions are like and can suggest different ways of explaining information.

### The session

#### 1. Awkward silence is ok

I ran my class as a back-and-forth participatory session: They copied chunks of code, refreshed the page, and saw what happened as we added more depth to the code. Standing up there, I saw a lot of blank faces and couldn't peek over their shoulder to see what they were doing. In that situation it's tempting to just think, well they're not talking, so it must be time to move on! 

... But realistically, they may just be pausing because they're taking extra time to process the information or catch up on typing. So wait. Even if it seems awkward, it's better to give them extra time to catch up than to rush through the material faster than your students can process it. This also gives them more time to come up with questions that can check your teaching of the material.

#### 2. The struggling students aren't going to speak up

You may as you teach get some nods or words of encouragement from the students (usually at the front of the classroom) who are ready to move on. Don't trust them! The students who are struggling are quiet, because they're still trying to understand the information. They may be shy about speaking out because they see the other people around them doing fine (even though those people may have started with a better knowledge base for the course.) That pause is helpful for getting them to start talking, but don't assume that because no one's complaining, they're ok.

#### 3. Always, always watch the time (and ask if they can hear you)

Timing is the trickiest part of a NICAR session. I didn't know for certain how long it would take to teach so many people, so I tried to design the tutorial to have some room to skip things at the end. But I think while teachers often do notice when they are running out of time, they don't always check the clock during the session to make sure they're halfway through the material when they're halfway through the session.

You definitely do not want to run over the time, if anything I would try to leave a minute or two of breathing space even if it means skipping a section. In those last few moments, they're going to be thinking about what session they're going to next, what to pack up, etc. and not be paying attention to the material particularly if you're rushing through it. 

#### 4. Can they see you? Can they hear you?

Just ask. Hell if you think you're going to forget put a slide in. They may speak up if they can't, but they often will not. And if they say they can't hear you, try to remember at regular intervals to check if you're speaking loud enough -- it's easy to forget and slip back into your normal speaking volume.

### Final thoughts

Just a reminder, to myself, when I'm stressing about this next year or whenever else: You're never going to get every single student in the class engaged with the material. Humans are lazy -- welcome to reality -- and people may go into the session who ignored the prerequisites or are going more because they think they should than because they really want to learn something.

But I worry that we fall back on that mentality too much in these classes, along with the justification that "well, you knew you weren't going to learn all this in an hour." I worry that rushing through the material and expecting just a few people to hang on is alienating those who have plenty of potential in coding but aren't attuned to that teaching style. And I worry that the people who are most likely to feel alienated are the people who are already susceptible to low self-esteem and imposter syndrome -- the women, minorities and other marginalized people in that class.

Personally, I'd like to foster confidence and a little curiosity in people who didn't expect to love coding, because I was in their shoes a short while ago. I hope that even if I occasionally stumble or forget to explain something clearly, I at least show them my enthusiasm and love for coding.
