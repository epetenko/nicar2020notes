# Leading the data team

How do you get the best out your brightest?

Encouraging creativity vs falling into service desk trap

Helping the higher editors to understand data

"When I'm a mom" -- as a kid, and then you become the mom and you get it

I had all these ideas about becoming an editor and then when I got there, I was like, ohhh

Talk to every reporter and ask -- what they want in their career and what they want from me

Challenge to data teams -- most traditional reporters have very clear career path, data teams are stuck in between two things

Younger data journalists - really makes up a lot of how they view their career and their self-worth

If you're not listening to that -- you'll have a lot of people leave. -- They get stuck doing stuff they don't want to do. 

Try to be really honest with them when recruiting -- you're not gonna write, because that's not what this job is

Data team means something different from every news organizations: Pure service desk, data driven story generation, etc.

What kind of team am I inheiriting, and what kind of team am I building?

Instilling ownership: Avoiding the service desk mentality
- Even if set up as a service desk -- instill sense of satisfaction
- matt - friends who were photogs/graphic artists -- they would tell me what it felt like to be a service desk
- Can be really alienating to be told what to do -- increase communication with the reporters and editors
- Difference between a story with one small thing we need vs wait a second, we need to be on that earlier
- sometimes managing a data team is managing the rest of the room and how they interact with your team
- We set up a request form: didn't want people to view us as "insert token, get data" -- as soon as we get a request, set up a meeting -- can you just go there and have a quick 10-minute conversation -- make sure you're all on the same page
- Having a separate criteria for credit: Get miscredit or no credit a lot -- if you couldn't do the story without me, I get a byline
- If they just added some Census figures or whatever -- add a tag. 
- Talked to photographer -- when reporter would go out on assignments, they would say "this is my photographer" -- I am my own person
- They absolutely need to be on the front end, need to have communication in person or over the phone
- Won't do emails -- too much lost in communication
- Too many assumptions between reporters and data
- Tell me what "done" looks like: Something quick, something in-depth
- Determine what requests we're gonna take vs something we don't have time to do
- I empower my data reporters to write their own stories too. Some of those have been best stories we've had

Managing beyond your skills
- Hard because they're doing things in a black box: Can't validate what they're doing
- For me it's been really helpful to pair them together 
- The simple ones can be the ones you have to be the most careful because you get lazy
- hit up someone at a different company, etc. 
- Have the confidence in yourself to have hired good people
- At least know what the capabilities are for the skillsets you hired
- "There's gonna be a time when you're not gonna know all of them": One of my team members built tool on framework I don't know
- If he's working on something -- I will make him sit there and explain it back to me -- it doesn't matter that I don't understand
- Rubber ducking -- speak to me so you understand it. He understands it well enough that he can explain it out loud
- Do something new -- Even if they don't know, I show it to them or have them show it to others like a mini-seminar
- We keep the dialogue open between each other
- Don't code shame your team members -- if it's not the best possible version, praise them first: Start with the positive stuff first, they say your suggestions for making a loop, functions, classes etc.
- When you say, I wouldn't have done it that way -- it visibly deflates them

Working with other teams
- We do a lot of work with the I-team: We know early on, we know the projects. Rest of room -- lot more managing expectations
- Most of the newsroom don't know how long it takes to do things
- Give a rough estimate of the time on task in hours. Is this our highest priority right now? Go to other editors
- Don't like to say no -- less no, and more we need to have a negotiation
- Have a more positive way to do that -- I want the newsroom to come to us, but have a reasonable expectation for how long it might take
- My boss: We need a request form, because they keep coming sideways at you. Sneak up on us
- Form: We try to approximate -- next week, next month, etc. 
- I will have someone who will never say it can wait, or they will always say it can wait
- I might not remember to come back to you, but you can come back to me -- stay on agenda 
- Sometimes will end up teaching them to do it themselves

Managing scope of responsibility
- Our biggest struggle at HC is our wide portfolio
